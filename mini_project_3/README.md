### Exploration of Databases

### Overview
  In this project, we explore various different databases and write a detailed report about them.
  After reporting on the various databases, we implement two, MongoDB and MySQL into Mini Project 1.
  Each database will contain the username, product, tweet, and sentiment score that a data scientist will be able to
  query and report on. A Jupyter-Notebook is provided to show how to query the data from these databases and visualize them.
